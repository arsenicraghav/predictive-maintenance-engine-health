# Predictive Maintenance – Engine Health Monitoring - MLOps

Predictive maintenance plays a crucial role in preventing unexpected engine failures, reducing operational costs, and improving the reliability of vehicles and machinery. 

This project builds an end-to-end MLOps pipeline using GitHub Actions, Hugging Face (dataset + Space), MLflow for tracking, and Streamlit UI.

## Project Workflow

✔ Add `HF_TOKEN` as a GitHub Actions secret. 
✔ Put `engine_data.csv` in the repo and push to `main`.
✔ End-to-end ML pipeline (EDA → Preprocessing → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment)  
✔ Pipeline runs automatically (register → prep → train/tune → publish → deploy).
✔ Real-world engine sensor analysis  
✔ Comparison of classical ML and ensemble models  
✔ Modular, readable, production-friendly code  
✔ Open the Streamlit app and test predictions.
